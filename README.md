# MuteSkipper

A funny little background application that simulates a media key "next" button press whenever an audio recording device's mute button is repeatedly pressed.

Works for headsets that mutes the microphone in windows when the mute button is pressed.

Made so I can skip songs in the kitchen when making eggs.
